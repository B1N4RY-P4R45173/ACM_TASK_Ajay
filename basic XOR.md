# Introduction
In this we are given the cipher text and we need to decrypt the plain text from it.
Since xor is one of the most powerful enecrytions on the internet and we cant directly decrypt it.
# Process
since we know the first starting part of the decrypted text that is `recr{`  we can use this to perform a crib dragging attack.

Used cyber chef and used to functions

 1) From Hex
 2) Xor

 Then I used the key `recr{` to find out the initial part of text.

 Found the starting of the text to be `bruhh`

 Then I used `Bruhh` as key to get the flag.

 # Flag Found
recr{X0r_4int_tough}
