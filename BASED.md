# Introduction
In this we are given a string which seems to be encoded multiple times.

# Process
 I used the website code chef to decode the bases one by one. first I used from base32 then base 58 then base 32 and again base 64. 
 
 I knew the other ones were incorrect since they did not produce a readable utf-8 encoding

 # Flag Found
`recr{Demn_You_just_reached_the_fourth_base_XD}`
